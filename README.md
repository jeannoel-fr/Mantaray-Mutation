# Mantaray-Mutation
First version of Mantaray Keyboard.

I love the design and ergonomy of the <a href="https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep/"> Ferris Sweep </a>. However, I often use graphical software - it means I often have a mouse in the right hand, and use the keyboard to trigger shortcuts. 

Mantaray Mutation is a attempt to keep the ergonomic shape of the Ferris Sweep, but monobloc and with one num rows in front of it. It's based on the great work of <a href="https://github.com/tuxedocurly/mantaray_keyboard">Colton Hawkins</a>, who created the Mantaray Keyboard.

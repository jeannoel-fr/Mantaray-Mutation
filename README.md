I love the design and ergonomy of the <a href="https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep/"> Ferris Sweep </a>. However, I often use graphical software - it means I often have a mouse in the right hand, and use the keyboard to trigger shortcuts. 

Mantaray Mutation is a attempt to keep the ergonomic shape of the Ferris Sweep, but:
- monobloc
- with one num row
- with 2 keys dedicated to shift and ctrl ( as mouse modifier )
- with a small lcd - to show wich layer is active


It's based on the great work of <a href="https://github.com/tuxedocurly/mantaray_keyboard">Colton Hawkins</a>, who created the Mantaray Keyboard.
